**It was July 2018.**

It had been a few months of pondering. Where will the next fulfillment at work come from? What would the next wayfaring challenge replete with learning, growth and joy be!

They say, be careful in what you wish for.

Yeah right!

An unknown man, to me, in a different part of the world, at the peak of his many professional powers, was searching for the next right move for him.

Manoj and I met through a common friend. Who was either having a moment of clairvoyance or vacuousness.

**August 2018**

I knew we live in a strange world.

A high achiever and a wayfarer with a different north. We shook hands.

We were high!

The concoction was the intent to create and deliver real value for individuals and businesses.

Stranger things have happened.

**September 2018**

Twimbit. A name for our idea emerged. Love at the first earshot!

The world is moved by ideas and technology. Wow. Indeed.

So let's move it!

What? How?

Ummmm...

**October 2018**

Let's start with a blockchain enabled digital locker to help store all their verified career and education records.

Hold on, what?

You are listening but not hearing.

I heard that before.

So, blockchain what?

Yeah, that.

Spend weeks figuring out the use cases and features.

Only to discover we were late entrants in that market.

Figure out it's a noble cause but it's too late.

**Nov-Dec 2018**

Our slogan to the world - Own Your Career. 

A career built on purpose and aspiration.

What's more important? 

What you have already done in life or what you are going to next? 

Disrupt LinkedIn.

Bring trust back. 

**Jan 2018**

We thought the new year brought with her a gift of clarity.

In a start up incubator, where I used to work as a co-worker, I observed a sharp, young fellow trying to establish his company.

He was a techie at heart. Only that he was the smartest one I had come across. He was also very helpful and patient in educating a on-tech fellow like me on various technologies and approaches. 

He was not a hush-hush kind about what he was working on in a competitive startup environment!

That's the guy we want our technology team built around, I thought.
