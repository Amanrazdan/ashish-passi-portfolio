July 2018

It had been a few months of pondering. Where will the next fulfillment at work come from? What would the next wayfaring challenge replete with learning, growth and joy be!

Manoj and I met through a common friend. Who was either having a moment of clairvoyance or vacuousness.

The idea of Twimbit emerged. The name itself a little later. Love at the first earshot!
