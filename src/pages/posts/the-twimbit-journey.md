Get. Set. Play.

**It was July 2018.**

It had been a few months of pondering. Where will the next fulfillment at work come from? What would the next wayfaring challenge replete with learning, growth and joy be!

They say, be careful in what you wish for.

Yeah right!

An unknown man, to me, in a different part of the world, at the peak of his many professional powers, was searching for the next right move for him.

Manoj and I met through a common friend. Who was either having a moment of clairvoyance or vacuousness.

**August 2018**

I knew we live in a strange world.

A high achiever and a wayfarer with a different north. We shook hands.

We were high!

The concoction was the intent to create and deliver real value for individuals and businesses.

Stranger things have happened.

**September 2018**

Twimbit. A name for our idea emerged. Love at the first earshot!

The world is moved by ideas and technology. Wow. Indeed.

So let's move it!

Ok. But....

In a start up incubator, where I used to work as a co-worker, I observed a sharp, young fellow trying to establish his company.

He was a techie at heart. Only that he was the smartest one I had come across. He was also very helpful and patient in educating a on-tech fellow like me on various technologies and approaches.

He was not a hush-hush kind about what he was working on in a competitive startup environment!

That's the guy we want our technology team built around, I thought.

Where do I find someone like him?

**Steve Blank** was imploring to 'step outside the building'. I had to be focused on market validation and keep a keen eye.

The 'heatmap' in what prospective customers shared was the most intense around ' an aspirational profile to find your purpose'!

People could relate with that!

But that was the third part of our value proposition after a digi locker,

**Mar 2019**

The Techstar Weekend is approaching soon from the 10th-12th.

A 60 second pitch to the community to begin with. 7 out of 35 pitches were to be shortlisted. They would team up and work on those 7 ideas for a whole weekend!

I'm driving there a little harebrained. It felt normal!

What was I going to pitch in 60 seconds?

The market validation till last evening was pointing to something different from our thinking of the last couple of months.

To help you Own Your Career, we were breeding Manage yourself, Market yourself and Develop yourself. The voice of the customer was the loudest around 'Develop yourself' !

![](/images/woman-driving-and-texting-on-mobile-smartphone-PWKJ57U.jpg)

It was a nervous drive that Friday evening to the event. I was thinking about the weekend already. After not clearing the 60 second pitch

But, it still had to be delivered.

Let's take a punt.

From a product that was a combination of digi locker- webpage - aspirational profile - to a product that was An aspirational profile ro find true purpose and meaning in work!

That had to be fit into 60 seconds. Practice while driving.

My technology friend, was also here to represent his idea. It just so happened, ours was selected and his wasn't in the pruning of 35 to 7.

Now that I had made it past the first round, it made sense to stay. My tech friend and 3 other strangers (who had come with their ideas too) joined forces to work through the weekend on our product that we christened **purposeFULL.ai.**

Lord behold, we won that weekend challenge. My tech friend displaying tremendous commitment and achievement orientation.

We brought with us the title, heaps of confidence and an acquaintance turned friend for life.

**April 2019**

Have we nailed it yet?

Far from it, sonny!

It's a long winding path through the woods!

![](/images/overgrown-boardwalk-CF2L6AN.jpg)

The various rounds of customer feedback and our innovations was moving purposeFull.ai towards a portal for job opportunities. This was not something that excited us boundless!

Knock! Knock!

Whose there?

Time. It's yours to move on!

Theme: Focus

Research was always going to be our core. The explorations of the past few months taught us the value of focus and sharpness.

Focus: Team

To do: Sharpen our value proposition / www.twimbit.com

The consulting role my tech friend was playing for us needed a tweak. His own startup had to be managed while he wanted to get away from having to sustain a business. He wanted to focus on building world-class products that could solve real problems for business and people.

He made the difficult decision of focusing on his passion with Twimbit and not having to worry about business numbers.

We had our Chief Technology Explorer. He is a beast. He finds solutions. Any. He will challenge the status quo. He learns fast. He is the high octane fuel for the platform we want to build.

The amalgamation of our experience and the innovative exuberance of youth had begun.

**Story - 5 Lessons for early stage team forming:**

* Get bound by a singular vision
* Leverage best practices from the experienced members of the team and young innovative minds to break barriers.
* No egos. The role of each member is the value you bring to the motto.
* Open and transparent communication
* Constant knowledge sharing
