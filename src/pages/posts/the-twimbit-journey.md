**It was July 2018.**

It had been a few months of pondering. Where will the next fulfillment at work come from? What would the next wayfaring challenge replete with learning, growth and joy be!

They say, be careful in what you wish for.

Yeah right!

An unknown man, to me, in a different part of the world, at the peak of his many professional powers, was searching for the next right move for him.

Manoj and I met through a common friend. Who was either having a moment of clairvoyance or vacuousness.

**August 2018**

I knew we live in a strange world.

A high achiever and a wayfarer with a different north. We shook hands. 

We were high!

The concoction was the intent to create and deliver real value for individuals and businesses.

Stranger things have happened.

Twimbit. A name to our idea emerged. Love at the first earshot!
